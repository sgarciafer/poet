# Po.et

This repository holds two different projects right now. They will be split into separate repositories in the future. Specific READMEs for each can be found in their respective folders.

### Node 

The backend. Will be split into its own repository, poet-node. It'll most likely be a rename of this repository, though it could be a new repository to keep this one for historic purposes. 

See Po.et Node's [README](./node)

### Web 

The frontend. This will be split into another repository, [poet-web](https://github.com/poetapp/web). 

See Po.et Web's [README](./web)
